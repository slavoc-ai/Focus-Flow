\#\# PRD (Product Requirements Document) for FocusFlow (MVP \- Extended v2.2 \- Finalized \+ Bolt Best Practices)  
\*\*Project Name:\*\* FocusFlow  
\#\#\# 1\. Introduction & Goals  
\* \*\*Description:\*\* FocusFlow is an intelligent task-tracking application that uses AI (specifically \*\*Gemini 2.5 Flash API\*\*) to break down large goals (including analysis of uploaded documents) into manageable steps and employs the Pomodoro Technique to maintain focus. It is designed for individuals who struggle with concentration and task initiation, with a special emphasis on \*\*students with ADHD\*\*, as well as anyone seeking to engage in deep work. The development will leverage Bolt.new, employing an iterative approach to build and refine features.  
\* \*\*Project Goals (MVP \- Extended v2.2):\*\*  
1\. \*\*Solve the Core Problem:\*\* Help users, especially students, overcome the overwhelm of large tasks and study materials by providing clear, AI-generated plans (including those based on uploaded documents) and structured work sessions, \*\*with options for both strict and advisory time management.\*\*  
2\. \*\*Deliver High-Quality Core Functionality:\*\* Implement the main user cycle: task input/document upload \-\> AI planning (using Gemini 2.5 Flash) \-\> fully customizable and editable Deep Work session with Pomodoro \-\> reliable progress and history saving with user authentication.  
3\. \*\*Provide User Flexibility with LLM:\*\* Allow users to input their own API key for their preferred LLM (with Gemini 2.5 Flash as the default if no user key is provided, or if the user key is for a different compatible model).  
4\. \*\*Ensure Excellent User Experience:\*\* Make interaction with the application intuitive, enjoyable, and motivating.  
5\. \*\*Test Key Hypotheses:\*\*  
\* Users are willing to trust AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) to analyze their study materials and create plans.

\* The integration of document analysis, AI planning, and Pomodoro significantly improves productivity.  
\* \*\*Users value control over their time management (strict/advisory) and API key usage.\*\*  
6\. \*\*Gather Feedback:\*\* Collect insights from early users for further product development.  
\* \*\*Target Audience:\*\*  
\* \*\*Primary:\*\* Students (especially those with ADHD) who need to process study materials (lectures, presentations, articles) and prepare using them.  
\* \*\*Secondary:\*\* Procrastinators, professionals aiming for Deep Work, individuals who find it hard to start large or undefined tasks.  
\#\#\# 2\. User Stories  
\* \*\*As a student with ADHD, I want to\*\* upload my lecture (PDF, PPT) or study material, \*\*so that\*\* FocusFlow (using Gemini 2.5 Flash) can analyze it and help me create a preparation/study plan.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* input a large task and specify the available time and my current energy level, \*\*so that\*\* AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) can suggest a realistic and adapted plan.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want\*\* the AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) to break down my large task (or material from a document) into small, understandable steps, \*\*so that\*\* I know where to start and don't feel overwhelmed.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* be able to easily and fully edit (add, delete, reorder, change text) the AI-suggested plan, \*\*so that\*\* it perfectly fits my needs.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* create an account and log in, \*\*so that\*\* all my tasks, plans, progress, and history are securely saved and accessible.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* start a "Deep Work" session based on the created plan, \*\*so that\*\* I can work focused using a Pomodoro timer with customizable intervals and sound notifications.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* see helpful tips for preparing for focused work while the plan is being generated, \*\*so that\*\* I can better prepare and use the waiting time productively.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* see the current task and a few upcoming/previous tasks in a volumetric, interactive carousel during a "Deep Work" session, \*\*so that\*\* I can easily navigate the plan.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want\*\* that when I complete a task in the carousel, it's marked as done, and the focus automatically shifts to the next task, which becomes more prominent.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* be able to view the entire task plan during a "Deep Work" session, \*\*so that\*\* I don't lose the overall picture.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want\*\* my progress on tasks and sessions to be reliably saved, \*\*so that\*\* I can return to work later from where I left off.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* see a clear history of my projects and completed tasks, \*\*so that\*\* I can track my productivity and achievements.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* specify when inputting a task whether the allocated time should be strictly adhered to, \*\*so that\*\* the AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) creates a plan that fits exactly within that time or warns me if it's not possible.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* specify when inputting a task that the allocated time is just a recommendation, \*\*so that\*\* the AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) creates the most comprehensive plan, which might take more or less than the specified time.  
\* \*\*As a user, I want to\*\* be able to enter my own LLM API key (e.g., for my personal Gemini or other compatible model) in the application settings, \*\*so that\*\* I can use my own resources for plan generation and potentially avoid service subscription fees or limits, while FocusFlow provides its own Gemini 2.5 Flash API key for default use or for subscribed users.  
\#\#\# 3\. Functional Requirements  
\#\#\#\# 3.1. Homepage / Task Input & Document Upload  
\* \*\*FR1.1: Main Task Input Field:\*\* A multi-line text area for users to describe their main goal or task.  
\* \*\*FR1.2: Time Allocation Input Field:\*\* A numeric input field or a dropdown/slider for users to specify the total time (e.g., in minutes or hours) they can dedicate to the task/session.  
\* \*\*FR1.3: "Strict Time Adherence" Checkbox:\*\*  
\* A standard checkbox, clearly labeled "Strict Time Adherence".  
\* Off by default.  
\* When checked, its appearance should subtly change to indicate an active state (e.g., border color change, checkmark becomes more prominent, or a small colored indicator light (e.g., green if on, grey if off) next to it).  
\* This flag influences the prompt sent to the Gemini 2.5 Flash API (see FR5.2).  
\* \*\*FR1.4: Energy Level Selector:\*\* A set of radio buttons, segmented control, or distinct buttons labeled "Low," "Medium," "High" for the user to indicate their current energy level. This also influences the AI prompt.  
\* \*\*FR1.5: "Upload Document" Button:\*\*  
\* A clearly labeled button (e.g., "Upload Document" or an icon) that opens the native OS file selection dialog.  
\* A designated drag-and-drop area can also be provided as an alternative.  
\* Supported formats for MVP: PDF, PPTX. The system should filter for these file types in the dialog.  
\* Display an indicator (e.g., spinner, progress bar, or text like "Processing document...") while the document is being uploaded (if applicable) and its text is being extracted.  
\* After successful text extraction, display the filename or a confirmation message.  
\* The extracted text is used as context for the Gemini 2.5 Flash API.  
\* \*\*FR1.6: "Create Plan / Start" Button:\*\*  
\* A prominent button that initiates the AI planning process.  
\* This button is enabled only when at least a main task description is provided.  
\* \*\*FR1.6.1: Display Loading/Processing Screen:\*\*  
\* Immediately after the "Create Plan / Start" button is clicked and before the AI-generated plan is displayed, a full-screen overlay or a prominent modal loading indicator (e.g., an animated FocusFlow logo, a smoothly animated gear, or a progress bar metaphor) should appear.  
\* \*\*Under or next to the loading indicator, short, helpful tips/reminders for preparing for deep work will be displayed. These tips will cycle (e.g., fade in/out every 3-5 seconds) or be chosen randomly from a predefined list. Examples:  
\* "Tip: Turn off all unnecessary notifications on your devices."  
\* "Tip: Put your phone on silent or 'Do Not Disturb' mode."  
\* "Tip: Prepare your workspace: clear away any clutter and have a drink nearby."  
\* "Tip: Pour a glass of water to stay hydrated."  
\* "Tip: Take a few deep breaths to center yourself before starting."  
\* "FocusFlow is thinking... Remember: small, consistent steps lead to big results\!"  
\* "Tip: Close unnecessary browser tabs to minimize distractions."  
\* This loading screen with tips remains visible until the Gemini 2.5 Flash API returns the generated plan and the application transitions to the Task Plan Screen. The duration should feel natural, masking the API call latency (expected to be relatively fast with Gemini 2.5 Flash, but still noticeable).  
\#\#\#\# 3.2. Task Plan Screen (AI-Generated Plan)  
\* \*\*FR2.1: Plan Display:\*\*  
\* A clear, scrollable list displaying the sub-tasks generated by the Gemini 2.5 Flash API.  
\* Each sub-task item should show its description.  
\* The plan is based on the user's input (task description, time, energy, strict time flag) and the content of any uploaded document.  
\* \*\*FR2.1.1: Feedback on Inability for Strict Time Adherence:\*\*  
\* If the "Strict Time Adherence" checkbox (FR1.3) was enabled, and the Gemini 2.5 Flash API indicates (or the application infers from the plan) that the full task cannot be realistically completed within the specified time:  
\* A clear, non-alarming message should be displayed above or alongside the plan (e.g., "Note: To fit your time, the AI has planned for the first part of your task. You can adjust the plan or extend your time.").  
\* The generated plan should represent the portion of the task that the AI deemed feasible within the time limit, potentially with a note from the AI if it can provide one.  
\* \*\*FR2.2: Comprehensive Plan Editing:\*\*  
\* \*\*Add Sub-task:\*\* A button (e.g., "+ Add Step") to insert a new, empty sub-task at the end of the list or at a selected position.  
\* \*\*Delete Sub-task:\*\* An icon (e.g., trash can) next to each sub-task to remove it. A confirmation prompt should appear before deletion.  
\* \*\*Edit Sub-task Text:\*\* Clicking on a sub-task's description should turn it into an editable text field. Changes are saved on blur or by pressing Enter.  
\* \*\*Reorder Sub-tasks:\*\* Implement intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for reordering sub-tasks within the list. Alternatively, "move up" and "move down" arrow buttons for each sub-task.  
\* \*\*FR2.3: "Start Deep Work Session" Button:\*\* A prominent button that, when clicked, saves the current (potentially edited) plan and transitions the user to the Deep Work Session screen.  
\#\#\#\# 3.3. Deep Work Session  
\* \*\*FR3.1: Fully Functional Pomodoro Timer:\*\*  
\* \*\*Large, Clear Display:\*\* The countdown timer (MM:SS format) must be the most dominant visual element on this screen, easily readable at a glance.  
\* \*\*Customizable Intervals (User Settings):\*\* The durations for work, short break, and long break intervals are configurable by the user in Application Settings (FR6.2). Defaults are 25 min (work), 5 min (short break), 15 min (long break).  
\* \*\*Sound Notifications (User Settings):\*\* Optional, distinct sounds will play at the end of each work interval and break interval, if enabled in Application Settings (FR6.3). Volume control is a future consideration.  
\* \*\*Automatic Switching (User Settings):\*\* An option in settings for the timer to automatically start the next interval (e.g., short break after work) or wait for user initiation. Default is manual start.  
\* \*\*Controls:\*\* Clearly visible buttons to:  
\* Start / Pause / Resume the current interval.  
\* Skip current interval (e.g., end break early, or skip to next break if work interval is done).  
\* Reset current Pomodoro cycle (optional, less critical for MVP).  
\* \*\*Cycle Tracking:\*\* The system keeps track of completed Pomodoro work cycles to determine when a long break should occur (e.g., after 4 work cycles).  
\* \*\*FR3.2: Interactive Task Carousel:\*\*  
\* \*\*Visual Design:\*\* Positioned below the Pomodoro timer, appearing as an integrated part of the focus experience.  
\* \*\*Horizontal & Volumetric:\*\* Displays approximately 3-5 sub-tasks simultaneously in a horizontal layout. The carousel should have a "volumetric" or 3D-like feel (e.g., using CSS transforms for perspective, scaling, opacity changes). The central, active task is largest and fully opaque/highlighted. Adjacent tasks are smaller, slightly faded, or partially skewed to create a sense of depth and focus on the current item.  
\* \*\*Navigation:\*\*  
\* Primarily auto-advances when a task is marked complete (FR3.3).  
\* Manual scrolling/swiping through the carousel to peek at adjacent tasks should be possible but not the primary interaction mode.  
\* \*\*Task Item Display:\*\* Each task item in the carousel clearly shows:  
\* The sub-task description.  
\* A large, easily clickable checkbox or a "Mark as Done" button.  
\* \*\*FR3.3: Interaction with Tasks in Carousel:\*\*  
\* \*\*Marking Done/Undone:\*\*  
\* Clicking the checkbox/button on the active task toggles its completion status (\`is\_completed\`).  
\* \*\*Visual Feedback:\*\* A completed task is visually distinct (e.g., text strikethrough, dimmed, checkmark appears).  
\* \*\*Auto-Advance:\*\* When the \*current active task\* is marked as complete, the carousel smoothly animates/scrolls to the \*next uncompleted task\* in the plan, making it the new central, active, and highlighted task. If all tasks are completed, a celebratory message or state is shown.  
\* \*\*FR3.4: Access to Full Plan:\*\* A discreet button or icon (e.g., "View Full Plan" or a list icon) that, when clicked, opens a modal window. This modal displays the entire list of sub-tasks for the current project, showing their descriptions and completion statuses (read-only view during the session). This allows users to regain context without leaving the Deep Work session.  
\* \*\*FR3.5: End Session Controls:\*\*  
\* \*\*"End Session" Button:\*\* A clear button to consciously end the current Deep Work session. Clicking this saves all progress (task completion statuses, Pomodoros completed in this session) and navigates the user away (e.g., to a session summary or back to the project list).  
\* \*\*"Interrupt Session" (Implicit):\*\* If the user navigates away or closes the tab, the application should attempt to save the current state (best-effort via \`beforeunload\`, but primary save is explicit "End Session").  
\#\#\#\# 3.4. Authentication, History & Progress  
\* \*\*FR4.1: Authentication System (Supabase Auth):\*\*  
\* \*\*User Registration:\*\* New users can register using Google OAuth (primary for MVP). Email/password registration can be added later if needed.  
\* \*\*User Login:\*\* Existing users can log in using Google OAuth.  
\* Supabase handles OAuth callbacks. The application should gracefully handle the session establishment and redirect the user to the main app interface (e.g., homepage) after successful authentication.  
\* \*\*FR4.2: Reliable Saving of Project/Task State:\*\*  
\* All project data (main task info, list of sub-tasks with their order and completion status) and user-specific settings (Pomodoro preferences, API key) are tied to the authenticated user's ID and stored securely in the Supabase database.  
\* Saving occurs when:  
\* A new plan is created and the user starts a Deep Work session.  
\* A Deep Work session is explicitly ended.  
\* Task statuses are updated within a session (can be debounced or saved periodically in addition to on-session-end).  
\* \*\*FR4.3: "My Projects / History" Section:\*\*  
\* Accessible from the homepage or a dedicated navigation item.  
\* Displays a list of all projects (both active and completed) created by the logged-in user, ordered by last updated or creation date.  
\* Each project list item should show:  
\* Project title (derived from the main task).  
\* Status: e.g., "In Progress (X/Y tasks done)", "Completed", "X Pomodoros done".  
\* Date of creation or last modification.  
\* \*\*FR4.4: Resume Work / View Project Details:\*\*  
\* Clicking a project in the "My Projects" list navigates the user to a view similar to the Task Plan Screen (FR3.2), pre-populated with that project's details and sub-tasks.  
\* From this view, the user can:  
\* Review the plan and its current completion status.  
\* Edit the plan (add/remove/modify sub-tasks).  
\* Start a new "Deep Work Session" for this project, continuing from where they left off (i.e., with previously completed tasks still marked as done).  
\* View a summary of past Pomodoro sessions for this project.  
\#\#\#\# 3.5. AI Integration (Gemini 2.5 Flash)  
\* \*\*FR5.1: LLM API Integration:\*\*  
\* The application will integrate with the \*\*Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API\*\* for generating task plans.  
\* API requests will be made securely from a Supabase Edge Function. Development will involve prompting Bolt.new to create the necessary Supabase Edge Function, e.g., 'Create a Supabase Edge Function to call the Gemini 2.5 Flash model with the prompt defined in FR5.2 and return the result.' Bolt will be expected to write the code to call this service.  
\* \*\*FR5.2: Prompt Engineering with "Strict Time Adherence":\*\*  
\* The prompt sent to Gemini 2.5 Flash will be dynamically constructed based on: main task description, extracted document text (if any), user's indicated available time, energy level, and the "Strict Time Adherence" flag.  
\* \*\*If "Strict Time Adherence" is enabled:\*\* The prompt will explicitly instruct Gemini 2.5 Flash to create a plan that can realistically be completed \*strictly within\* the \`{TIME\_AVAILABLE}\`. It should also ask Gemini to indicate if the entire task cannot be covered and to plan only for the feasible part.  
\* \*Example prompt guidance:\* "Break down the following task: '{USER\_TASK}' \[Optional: based on this document context: '{DOCUMENT\_TEXT}'\] into a series of actionable sub-steps. The user has {TIME\_AVAILABLE} and their energy level is {ENERGY\_LEVEL}. \*\*The plan must strictly fit within the allocated time.\*\* If the entire task cannot be completed, provide a plan for the maximum achievable portion within this time and briefly note that. Present the plan as a JSON array of objects, each object having a 'sub\_task\_description' field. Optionally, include an 'estimated\_minutes\_per\_sub\_task' field."  
\* \*\*If "Strict Time Adherence" is disabled:\*\* The prompt will instruct Gemini 2.5 Flash to use \`{TIME\_AVAILABLE}\` as a strong \*recommendation\* or guideline for the plan's overall length, but allows the AI to generate a more comprehensive plan if it slightly exceeds or is less than the time, if beneficial for task completion.  
\* \*Example prompt guidance:\* "...Use {TIME\_AVAILABLE} as a guideline for the total duration. The plan can be adjusted if necessary for a comprehensive breakdown of the task. ..."  
\* The system will request JSON output from Gemini 2.5 Flash for easy parsing of sub-tasks.  
\* \*\*FR5.3: Document Processing for Context:\*\*  
\* Client-side JavaScript libraries (e.g., \`pdf.js\` for PDF, \`pptxjs\` or similar for PPTX) will be used to extract raw text content from uploaded documents.  
\* This extracted text will be included in the prompt to Gemini 2.5 Flash to provide context for plan generation (e.g., "plan study steps for the following lecture notes: \[extracted text\]").  
\* For very large documents, a strategy for chunking or summarizing the text before sending it to Gemini 2.5 Flash might be needed to stay within token limits, though Gemini 2.5 Flash has a large context window (1 million tokens). For MVP, assume documents are reasonably sized or pass the full text.  
\* \*\*FR5.4: User's LLM API Key & Default Gemini 2.5 Flash Usage:\*\*  
\* If a user provides their own API key in settings (FR6.1) (e.g., for their personal Gemini account or another compatible LLM), the application will use that key for their requests via a secure Supabase Edge Function call.  
\* If no user key is provided, or for users on a potential free tier/trial, the application will use a centrally managed FocusFlow API key for Gemini 2.5 Flash (this implies secure backend handling via a Supabase Edge Function to avoid exposing the FocusFlow key client-side, managing rate limiting/quotas).  
\* The system must clearly communicate which API key is being used.  
\#\#\#\# 3.6. Application Settings  
\* \*\*FR6.1: LLM API Key Input Field:\*\*  
\* A dedicated section in "Settings" for users to input their personal LLM API key.  
\* A text field for the API key.  
\* A dropdown to select the LLM provider if other models beyond Gemini are to be supported by user keys (For MVP, primarily target Gemini).  
\* A "Save Key" button.  
\* An optional "Test Key" button could make a simple, inexpensive call to the LLM API to verify the key is valid.  
\* \*\*Security:\*\*  
\* \*\*Server-side (Preferred for better security, via Supabase Edge Functions):\*\* The key is sent to an Edge Function, encrypted using \`pg\_sodium\` or Supabase Vault (if applicable), and stored in the \`profiles\` table associated with the user. API calls using this key would then be proxied through another Edge Function that retrieves and decrypts the key for use. Bolt.new will be prompted to create these Edge Functions for secure key handling and API proxying.  
\* A "Clear Key" or "Use Default FocusFlow Key" option.  
\* \*\*FR6.2: Default Pomodoro Timer Settings:\*\*  
\* Input fields allowing users to set their preferred default durations (in minutes) for:  
\* Work Interval  
\* Short Break Interval  
\* Long Break Interval  
\* Number of work intervals before a long break.  
\* These settings are saved to the user's profile in Supabase and used when new Deep Work sessions are initiated.  
\* \*\*FR6.3: Notification Settings:\*\*  
\* A toggle switch to enable or disable sound notifications for Pomodoro timer events (end of work, end of break).  
\* This preference is saved to the user's profile.  
\#\#\# 4\. Non-Functional Requirements  
\* \*\*NFR1: Performance:\*\*  
\* The UI must be highly responsive, with minimal lag, especially during interactions within the Deep Work session (timer, carousel).  
\* API calls to Gemini 2.5 Flash should be handled asynchronously with clear loading indicators. Given Gemini 2.5 Flash's speed, user-perceived latency should be minimized.  
\* \*\*The loading screen with tips (FR1.6.1) should effectively mask the typical 5-15 second API call duration for plan generation, ensuring tips can cycle a few times.\*\*  
\* Efficient client-side processing for document text extraction.  
\* \*\*NFR2: User Interface (UI):\*\*  
\* The design must be simple, clean, intuitive, and modern, embodying a "unified design" aesthetic.  
\* Minimalist approach, particularly in the Deep Work session, to avoid distracting the user.  
\* Aesthetically pleasing to encourage use.  
\* The task carousel must be visually engaging and clearly indicate the active task.  
\* \*\*NFR3: User Experience (UX):\*\*  
\* Smooth and logical transitions between screens/states.  
\* Minimal clicks required to perform core actions.  
\* Predictable application behavior.  
\* All key features (Pomodoro timer, plan creation and editing, progress saving, settings) must work flawlessly ("excellently" as per the goal).  
\* Clear feedback for all user actions (e.g., saving, errors, loading).  
\* \*\*NFR4: Reliability & Stability:\*\*  
\* The application must be stable and minimize crashes or freezes.  
\* Correct and reliable saving and retrieval of all user data (projects, sub-tasks, settings, session history) from Supabase.  
\* Graceful handling of network errors or API unavailability.  
\* \*\*NFR5: Security:\*\*  
\* Secure storage and handling of user credentials (managed by Supabase Auth).  
\* \*\*Secure handling of user-provided LLM API keys (as per FR6.1 security notes, preferably via Supabase Edge Functions).\*\*  
\* If FocusFlow's own Gemini 2.5 Flash API key is used, it must not be exposed on the client-side; requests should be proxied via a backend (e.g., Supabase Edge Function).  
\* Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF) through standard best practices and framework features.  
\* Row Level Security in Supabase must be correctly configured to ensure data privacy.  
\* \*\*NFR6: Development with bolt.new:\*\* The application should leverage the capabilities and conventions of the \`bolt.new\` platform for efficient development, deployment, and maintenance.  
\* Employ clear, specific, and iterative prompting strategies when working with Bolt.new, breaking down complex features into smaller, manageable build steps.  
\* Utilize Bolt.new's "Discuss" mode with visual context (screenshots) for UI refinements.  
\* Leverage Bolt.new's "Knowledge Base" (Project Prompts and Global System Prompts) to store consistent instructions, brand guidelines (colors, fonts), and preferred coding patterns to guide Bolt's generation throughout the project.  
\* Use Bolt's "Diffs" mode feature preview for minor, targeted code changes to save tokens and improve speed where appropriate.  
\#\#\# 5\. Design & UX Considerations  
\* \*\*Consistent Style:\*\* Adherence to a well-defined design system:  
\* \*\*Color Palette:\*\* A primary palette that is calming and promotes focus (e.g., blues, greens, muted tones) with accent colors for calls-to-action and important states (e.g., active timer, alerts).  
\* \*\*Typography:\*\* Clear, legible fonts with a well-defined hierarchy for headings, body text, and UI elements.  
\* \*\*Iconography:\*\* Consistent and intuitive icons (e.g., from a library like Lucide Icons or Material Symbols).  
\* \*\*Controls:\*\* Uniform styling for buttons, inputs, checkboxes, etc.  
\* \*\*Content Focus:\*\* The design should prioritize content (task descriptions, timer) over excessive chrome or decoration.  
\* \*\*Loading Screen with Tips (FR1.6.1):\*\*  
\* \*\*Visuals:\*\* The loading indicator should be non-jarring and visually appealing (e.g., smooth animation, perhaps related to the FocusFlow brand).  
\* \*\*Tips:\*\* Text should be short, easily scannable, and encouraging. Font size and contrast must ensure readability. Smooth animated transitions (e.g., fade-in/fade-out) between tips.  
\* \*\*Deep Work Session UI (FR3.1, FR3.2):\*\*  
\* \*\*Timer:\*\* Must be the undeniable focal point. Large, high-contrast numerals.  
\* \*\*Task Carousel:\*\* The "volumetric" effect should be implemented subtly to enhance focus on the current task without being overly distracting. Animations for scrolling and task completion should be smooth and quick. Visual distinction between active, upcoming/previous, and completed tasks must be clear.  
\* \*\*Feedback Mechanisms:\*\*  
\* Visual feedback for all significant actions: loading indicators for API calls, success confirmations (e.g., "Plan Saved"), error messages (clear, user-friendly, and actionable if possible).  
\* Subtle hover and focus states for interactive elements.  
\* \*\*Intuitiveness & Learnability:\*\*  
\* Users should be able to understand and use core features with minimal or no instruction.  
\* Workflow should feel natural for task breakdown and focused work.  
\* \*\*"Strict Time Adherence" Checkbox (FR1.3):\*\* Its visual state (enabled/disabled) must be immediately obvious.  
\* \*\*Settings Page (FR3.6):\*\* Must be clearly organized and easy to navigate. Explanations or tooltips for settings like API key input should be provided.  
\#\#\# 6\. Technical Considerations  
\* \*\*Development Platform:\*\* Assumed to be a web application, potentially using \`bolt.new\` if it's a full-stack development platform. If \`bolt.new\` is primarily a frontend builder, a separate backend (like Supabase) is essential.  
\* \*\*\`bolt.new\` Capabilities:\*\* Need to verify \`bolt.new\`'s support for:  
\* Custom JavaScript/TypeScript for complex logic.  
\* Integration with external APIs (Gemini, Supabase).  
\* Client-side file handling and parsing (for PDF, PPTX).  
\* Secure environment variable management.  
\* Building and deploying SPA (Single Page Applications).  
\* \*\*Frontend Technology Stack:\*\* Likely React, Vue, or Svelte with TypeScript.  
\* State Management: React Context, Zustand, Jotai, or Redux Toolkit depending on complexity.  
\* Routing: React Router or similar.  
\* Styling: Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Emotion.  
\* \*\*Backend & Database:\*\* Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions, Storage).  
\* Edge Functions will be used for secure operations like proxying calls with a central API key, encrypting/decrypting user-specific API keys, and other backend logic.  
\* \*\*AI API:\*\* Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API.  
\* Requires an API key.  
\* SDKs or direct HTTP requests (via Supabase Edge Functions) will be used for interaction.  
\* \*\*Document Parsing Libraries (Client-Side):\*\*  
\* PDF: \`pdf.js\` (Mozilla).  
\* PPTX: \`pptxjs\`, \`read-pptx\`, or similar JavaScript libraries. Evaluate based on robustness and ease of integration.  
\* \*\*LLM API Key Storage (FR6.1):\*\*  
\* \*\*Server-side (via Supabase Edge Functions \- preferred):\*\* Key is encrypted (e.g., using \`pg\_sodium\`) and stored in the \`profiles\` table. API calls are then proxied by an Edge Function that handles decryption and makes the call to Gemini. This keeps the user's key off the client. Bolt.new will be prompted to create these Edge Functions for secure key handling and API proxying.  
\* \*\*Tips List for Loading Screen (FR1.6.1):\*\* Can be a simple array of strings hardcoded in the frontend for MVP.  
\* \*\*Tips Display Mechanism (FR1.6.1):\*\* JavaScript logic (\`useEffect\`, \`setInterval\`) to cycle through the tips array while the loading state is active.  
\#\#\# 7\. Success Metrics for MVP  
\* \*\*User Engagement & Adoption:\*\*  
\* Number of registered users.  
\* Daily Active Users (DAU) / Weekly Active Users (WAU).  
\* Average number of plans created per user.  
\* Average number of "Deep Work" sessions started and completed per active user.  
\* \*\*Feature Effectiveness:\*\*  
\* Percentage of users successfully uploading a document and generating a plan from it.  
\* Percentage of sub-tasks marked as completed within sessions.  
\* Usage rate of the "Strict Time Adherence" option.  
\* Percentage of users inputting their own LLM API key (vs. using the default).  
\* \*\*User Retention & Satisfaction:\*\*  
\* 1-week and 1-month user retention rates.  
\* Qualitative feedback from user surveys, interviews, or in-app feedback forms regarding:  
\* Ease of use and intuitiveness.  
\* Effectiveness of AI-generated plans.  
\* Usefulness of the Pomodoro timer and task carousel.  
\* Perception of the loading screen tips.  
\* Overall satisfaction and perceived impact on productivity/focus.  
\* \*\*Technical Performance & Stability:\*\*  
\* Low error rates for document processing and Gemini API interactions.  
\* Application uptime and low incidence of critical bugs.  
\* Page load times and API response times within acceptable limits.  
\#\#\# 8\. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for MVP)  
\* \*\*Enhanced Task Import/Export:\*\*  
\* \*\*Integration with popular task managers:\*\* Direct API integration to import/export tasks from/to Todoist, Microsoft To Do/Planner, Google Tasks.  
\* \*\*Flexible CSV Import with AI:\*\* Allow users to upload CSV files. AI (Gemini) attempts to parse the CSV (even with non-standard formats) to identify task names, descriptions, deadlines, and suggests them for import. User reviews and confirms before import.  
\* \*\*Task Export:\*\* Allow exporting FocusFlow plans/tasks to standard formats (CSV, JSON, iCalendar for sessions).  
\* \*\*Advanced AI Features:\*\*  
\* More advanced document analysis with Gemini (e.g., Q\&A over the document, summarization beyond just plan generation, identifying key concepts).  
\* Support for more document formats, potentially including OCR for image-based PDFs or images.  
\* Option to choose different AI planning "strategies" or "personalities" for Gemini (e.g., "quick overview," "detailed academic breakdown," "creative brainstorming mode").  
\* Personalized AI recommendations for improving focus based on user's session history and task completion patterns.  
\* \*\*Collaboration & Sharing:\*\*  
\* Ability to share a FocusFlow plan with another user (view-only or collaborative editing).  
\* Team features for small groups (if a market need is identified).  
\* \*\*Platform Expansion:\*\*  
\* Native mobile applications (iOS, Android) for on-the-go planning and session tracking.  
\* Browser extension for quick task capture or starting focus sessions.  
\*\*Enhanced User Experience & Customization:\*\*  
\* Calendar integrations (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar) for scheduling Deep Work sessions.  
\* Advanced productivity statistics, charts, and dashboards.  
\* More granular tagging, categorization of tasks, and creation of complex projects with dependencies.  
\* Gamification elements: achievement badges, streaks, points for completing plans and maintaining focus.  
\* More theme customization options.  
User ability to add their own custom "preparation" rituals/tips to the loading screen.  
Support for multiple LLM providers via user-provided API keys, with a UI to select the active one.  
More detailed analytics on user API key usage (if key is provided and calls are proxied).  
\*\*Monetization (Post-MVP):\*\*  
\* Subscription tiers for advanced features, higher API usage limits (if using a central FocusFlow key), or team functionalities.
